# Impact Labs Fellow Project

What has a greater potential for change: plastic bottles or people? 31% of plastic bottles are recycled, however, 3.7% of formerly incarcerated people get a job, 6 months after they get out of prison. 

We've created The Connecting Piece to solve the following problems:

a) Simplified Process to find jobs: From writing the first email to your first interview, our resource hub can help.                                    
b) Finding jobs that actually hire the formerly incarcerated: Our board is focused only on curating relevant opportunities   
c) Creating a support network: A kind and compassionate community of mentors and mentees.
